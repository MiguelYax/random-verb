# Random Verb

Random verb with past and past participe.

I am an english learner, but I want an easy way to memorize verbs without write on a phisical notebook, for that reason I will be use and this repository. 

The main idea is use Flash cards technique that it is good for specific facts. Shuffle cards and recite out loud. Put a question on one side, the answer on the other.

I hope It could help you as well.
